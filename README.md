Hey there!

I'm a recenetly graduate student with master's degree in CS. I have an excelent background in areas such as Online learning and data-streams, Deep Learning, and Reinforcement learning.

You can find our research work in exlainability of transformers in the CSI5138 repository, which we worked on changing the weights on attentions in the tranformer model to examine their performance. 

IOE repository is the source code for our publication "Multi-class imbalanced semi-supervised learning from streams through online ensembles". In this paper, we introduce a new method for dealing with multi-class imbalanced data.
