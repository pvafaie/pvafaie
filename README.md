Hey there!

I'm a recenetly graduate student with master's degree in CS. I have an excelent background in areas such as Online learning and data-streams, Deep Learning, and Reinforcement learning.

You can find our research work in exlainability of transformers in the CSI5138 repository, which we worked on changing the weights on attentions in the tranformer model to examine their performance. 

Online Reinforce SSL is the source code for our publication " Online semi-supervised learning from evolvingdata streams with meta-features and deepreinforcement learning". In this paper we introduced a new method for dealing with Online Semi-supervised learning by using a meta-reinforcement learning for pseudo-labelling unlabelled instances. 

IOE repository is the source code for our publication "Multi-class imbalanced semi-supervised learning from streams through online ensembles". In this paper, we introduce a new method for dealing with multi-class imbalanced data.

Both of the reseach projects above can also be found in my thesis:
